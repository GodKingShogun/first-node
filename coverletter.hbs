"Dear Mr. or Ms.,

I am a self taught developer with the help of free code camp community and various other references and suggestions from the free code camp community.

I have built applications using css, html, and javascript. Including the previous mentioned languages, I have experience with bootstrap, font awesome, flex, and jquery. I earned my front end developing certificate from free code camp and I am currently learning node.js and plan to learn angular after that. 

I have a passion for developing and I believe this willingness to learn new content is the reason I would make an ideal candidate for this position and later positions that require additional skill sets.

Sincerely,
David Amanze"
