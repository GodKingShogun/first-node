Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a self taught developer with the help of free code camp community and various other references and suggestions from the free code camp community.

I have experience with css, html, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, font awesome, flexbox, and anything else front end developing related. I earned my front end developing certificate from free code camp and I am currently learning nodejs to support my backend repertoire. You can view my projects by going to http://agile-wildwood-21225.herokuapp.com.

I prefer to self learn and I believe my willingness to learn new content is the reason I would make an ideal candidate for this position and later positions that require additional skill sets.

Sincerely,
David Amanze
